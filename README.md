# Flocking

Programmer Craig Reynolds defined this behavior according to three rules:

1. Separation - Members will steer to maintain a defined distance from one another
2. Alignment - Members will steer to face in a similar direction as members around them
3. Cohesion - Members will steer to remain close to the flock
